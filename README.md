# dEX- De-centralised Cryptocurrency Exchange

Hi and Welcome to my Blockchain Bootcamp Graduation project.

In this DApp, you can trade ERC20 Cryptocurrencies, but what makes this different from other Cryptocurrency exchanges, is that this runs on a Blockchain and powered by Smart Contracts, as opposed to traditional Exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, which runs on web-servers.

In this project we have smart contracts which are talking to the front-end application, so you can make some Cryptocurrency trades in a De-Centralised way.

Please be aware, not all features are fully functional at the moment, and this project to be continued ...

Kind regards, 
Szabika Veres
